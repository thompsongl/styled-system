Other developers like to write CSS, and that's also completely fine, but this library probably isn't necessary for teams of fewer than 10 people where most have a good understanding of CSS.\n- With styled-components and other libraries, you can still escape into low-level CSS using things like the `.extend()` method\nWhen I first released Basscss, people hated it. When I first introduced Rebass, people hated it. Some ideas like this take time to gain traction, but I've received a surprising amount of positive feedback around the library so far, and I suspect that there's some value in approaches like this\n")))}}}]);
